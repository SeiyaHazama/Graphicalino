Can graphical data of Arduino serial data and create CSV file.

## Description

Graphicalino is tool for see graphical of Arduino serial data. Usually, think everyone use serial monitor of Arduino IDE or simple tool of you made, when everyone see serial data.
Serial monitor of Arduino IDE is very easy for see data. But, serial monitor is can't export to CSV data.
Simple tool for like run at terminal is can export CSV data. But, develop tool is diffical for begginer.
Therefor, I develop Graphicalino. Graphicalino is easy operate and can export CSV data.

This develop started for my practice of Electron. So, This software is may be unstable.
